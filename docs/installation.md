# Installation

## Python Package
To create reports you need to install the `ngi_reports` package.
First, either download or clone the [repository](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/ngi_reports).
Install the package by running:

```
python setup.py install
```

This should install all dependencies so that the python code is ready to run.
If you're intending to make changes to the code, use `develop` instead of `install`
so that you don't need to run the setup script each time you make a change.

Next, you need a config file in your home directory called
`~/.ngi_reports/ngi_reports.conf`. This should look like this:

```bash
[ngi_reports]
support_email: genomics_support@scilifelab.se
ngi_node: stockholm
```

Obviously, if you're working at the Uppsala NGI node, use `uppsala` instead
of `stockholm`.

## Pandoc Conversion
NGI reports use [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/)
to convert the autogenerated Markdown files into HTML and PDF reports.
Head to the [pandoc installation page](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/installing.html)
and download the appropriate version for your system. Make sure that you also
download and install LaTeX and all of the LaTeX packages that you can get your
hands on.

### Fonts
The LaTeX to PDF conversion uses two fonts - **Helvetica Neue** for headings
and body text, and **Consolas** for code. If you're using Mac OSX you can get
Consolas by following the instructions in
[this blog post](http://zjhzxhz.com/2014/01/install-microsofts-consolas-font-on-mac-os-x/).
