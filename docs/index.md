# NGI Reports Documentation

This documentation describes the code in the
[ngi_reports](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/ngi_reports)
github repository.

## Introduction
A common task within NGI is to create user reports. These can range from
delivery reports containing basic sample information through to Best Practice
reports with in-depth analysis.

The `ngi_reports` package is a common framework for generating reports
with consistent styling.  It's designed to work for both NGI Stockholm and
Uppsala nodes. To facilitate this, code is divided into three modules:
`common`, `stockholm` and `uppsala`.

This documentation contains information about:

* [Installation](installation.md)
* [Usage](usage.md)
* [General notes on contributing](contributing.md)
* Specific information about each report type
